# Software Engineering Best Practices, a Machine Learners Perspective

This repository is meant to serve as an opinionated, pedagogical guide on software engineering best practices for those of us in machine learning.

__What is this guide NOT?__

It is _NOT_ a comprehensive overview of best practices in software engineering. It is a highly opinionated sampling of tools and ideas that are important for writing good code in a machine learning project. This includes linting, formatting and testing.

__Who is this guide for?__

Machine learners who are not currently following software engineering best practices in their projects but would like to.

__What is machine learning specific about this guide?__

In truth, nothing important. We use `python` as the language of choice as it is popular in machine learning, and we write some machine learning specific tests. Otherwise, this guide could apply to (almost) any python project.

__What tools will this guide cover?__

- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#system-requirements), for managing virtual enviornments and package dependencies.
- [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), for linting.
- [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/), for formatting.
- [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), for testing.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), for continous integration / continous development (CI/CD).
